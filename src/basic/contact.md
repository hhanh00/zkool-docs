1. List of contacts by name
1. Buttons to save and add new contacts

Saving the contacts writes the address to the blockchain.
You can edit and delete contacts by *long* pressing/tapping
on it. It switches the list to *Edit* mode.

Don't forget to save your modifications if you want them
kept across devices.

The address book stores addresses and matches their *receivers*.
See [Addresses](../intermediate/address.md) for more information.

# Backups

```admonish warning
Making a backup of the seed phrase is
the **MOST IMPORTANT** thing to do.
```

Without the 24-word seed phrase, there is
no way to recover your funds if you happen
to lose access to your device[^1].

However, it is also important to remember that
the seed phrase gives **full access** to the
funds.

```admonish warning
Anyone with the seed phrase can spend all your funds.
```

There is no "customer service" support[^2] and
no refunds possible.

You must keep it in a safe place, away from
unauthorized people.

> Treat the seed phrase as your **master password**
but without a "forgot my password" option.

When you create a new account, the main page
shows a reminder "BACKUP MISSING". It is a button
that leads to the backup page.

Over there, you will find the seed phrase.
You can also access the backup page through
the More tab, then "Seed & Keys"[^3].

There is a toggle at the bottom of the page
that turns off the reminder from the main page.

is stolen, breaks down, or the app is uninstalled.

transactions is a scammer.

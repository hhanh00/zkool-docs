# Market Price & Account History

![Market Price]({{rootUrl}}/images/2024-11-07_19-34-46.png "market" =450x)

Zkool/YWallet has an embedded *real time* market price chart[^1]
that can display the historical trading price of ZEC[^2]

```admonish warning
All transactions are executed in ZEC. When you input an amount
in FIAT, it gets converted to ZEC based on the current market price.
Though the source comes from a reputable website (Coingecko),
*it can still be incorrect*.
```

> You can change the time interval using the dropdown.

## Budget and Account Balance History

On the Budget page, you will see the top 5 addresses
to which you sent the largest amount 

Below that table, you have a chart of your account balance
for the past year.

# Multi-Recipients

These transactions work pretty much like several individual
transactions, but because all the recipients are included
at once, you pay less in fees, and you don't have to wait
for the change between each transaction.

You create them by using the "Multi Pay" menu in the "More" tab.
Then you add the recipients one by one, and submit
the whole batch as a single transaction.

> You can "save" the recipient list by creating a Payment URI
from the "Multi Pay" menu[^1]. Then use the QR code or the
URI string.

[^1]: Though a multi-recipient Payment URI is allowed
by the standard, only a few wallet apps support them.

# Accounts

You can have more than one account in your wallet.
Each account maintains its balance, notes, transaction, history,
contact, etc. independently.

> Synchronization updates all the accounts simultaneously.

The more accounts you have, the slower synchronization gets.
It's best to delete unused accounts. Just make sure you have
the seed phrase.
